>   ```
>   app/
>     book/
>       page.tsx
>       preorder/page.tsx
>       register/page.tsx
>       success/page.tsx
>     blog/
>       page.tsx
>       [slug]/page.tsx
>     contact/page.tsx
>     about/page.tsx
>     layout.tsx
>     page.tsx
>   components/
>     ui/
>     sections/
>     forms/
>   lib/
>   ```
> * Keep components modular and theme-aware.
> * All styles should adapt automatically between light and dark themes.
> * Ensure accessibility (aria-labels, alt tags, color contrast).
> * Make sure the design feels “ready for clients and audiences” — premium, polished, and easy to expand later.
