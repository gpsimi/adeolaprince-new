Prince surely has received something from on high and has been sent by the Power of the Highest, to his generation and indeed all who will come across his works.

This piece is a very rich mosaic of literary beauty, with words striking simply yet powerfully upon each reader's heart. Its pages convey the depths of light and wisdom needed to sharpen your perspectives towards life. No one will think the same way after traveling through its pages.

My desire is to see this book represented in every household of the world.

Wow, thank you so much for this great piece, Brother Prince Adeola. This is truly astounding and, if I may add, astonishing. Chapter Six alone is filled with wisdom and excellence on every side. Your thoughts were well arranged, well structured, and deeply impactful. I’m honestly blessed by this — every line and every point stood out for me.

I’m humbled and honoured to be one of the first to read this great work. Thank you so much, man of God.

Please note that I’ll be requesting 11 copies ahead for myself and some of my students. God has blessed you.

I love the use of Imagery and how practical the explanations are. It makes for easy understanding. A person who knows nothing would know a lot by the end of this book.

Consistently intriguing, engaging, insightful and every line begs me to reflect on how my DERICE has shaped my perceptions over the years. This is simply a piece of art.

Review:
This is a deeply rich and well-written book. If just one chapter carries this much depth, I can only imagine how transformative the rest of the book will be. It’s insightful and practical, filled with relatable examples that make its lessons easy to understand and apply. The writing stirs deep reflection, prompting genuine self-examination and inspiring personal growth. It’s a powerful read that leaves the reader with a sincere desire for change.

Wow! Wow wow! There's so many gems contained in every page, it makes me more excited to get my hands on this book. I love how you included bits and pieces of some of your personal experiences as it makes it relatable when reading but also shows you the importance of perspective. Funny enough this has also reminded me about the importance of giving grace to people because we all see life through different lenses!

 Indeed, environment, upbringing, and internal belief systems act like lenses, shaping the way we see life, just as different glasses alter how we perceive light. 

This is indeed a must-read for everyone. Drawing on personal experiences, including his early fascination with aviation and subtle influences like a neighbour’s love of tennis, Prince shows how powerful our surroundings truly are.

Also, an amazing part I love most is when he takes the reader(you and me) on a journey through the unseen forces, family habits, repeated exposures, and even background music that silently mould our passions, decisions, and perspectives. Whether it’s how we pick up songs without learning them word-for-word, or how our worldview is formed long before we understand it, this chapter challenges us to rethink how we’ve been shaped.

Another amazing part is the introduction of the framework called *D.E.R.I.C.E.* to us.—Discipline, Environment, Revelation, Information, Choices, and Experiences—six key elements that colour how we see life, truth, purpose, and even faith.

You shouldn't miss out on this amazing book!

Prince Adeola has written a book far beyond his years. Wise, reflective, and deeply enlightening. 
As an ardent follower of his work, I continue to be amazed by the clarity and maturity of his delivery.

Hello, I’m Light truly lives up to its name. It's a rich collection of insight, truth, and revelation. The juxtaposition of words, real-life scenarios, and thoughtfully selected case studies all come together in a style that is both subtle and deeply impactful.

What strikes me most is how this book causes my mind to revisit the past, not to dwell there, but to gain perspective, to understand who I am now, and to see clearly the path to who I can become.

This is more than a book. It’s a life guide.

I highly recommend Hello, I’m Light,  to readers of all.

Disclaimer: You might need to keep a dictionary nearby, and that’s one of the things I love most about it. It stretches the mind and feeds the soul.

A complete and brilliant delivery. Well done, Prince.
